There are 875 samples in total. I divided them into 729 samples for training and 146 samples for testing.
You can adjust the ratio of training and testing samples.  
The sample size is 8*8. 
In each folder, the label of each sample is indicated by the folder name.
The final output I need is the index of the sample (filename), prediction results, and confusion matrix.
